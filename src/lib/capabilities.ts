 * What speech engines are actually available, decided once at boot.
 *
 * The whole point is that the app runs for anyone. A student who has done
 * nothing but install Claude Code and log in gets the browser's own speech
 * recognition and voice — no keys, no accounts, it just works. A student who
 * also has an ElevenLabs key (in their Claude Code config or a .env) gets Scribe
 * transcription and the ElevenLabs voice instead, automatically, with no flag to
 * set. This module is how the rest of the app learns which of those two worlds
 * it is in, so voice.ts and tts.ts never have to guess.
 *
 * The premium paths both live behind the bridge — it holds the key and makes
 * the calls, so the browser never sees a secret. In direct mode (no bridge)
 * only a key baked into the bundle could reach ElevenLabs for speech, and that
 * is not a path worth encouraging, so direct mode is treated as browser-only.
