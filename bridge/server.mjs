 *      and hand a browser-that-isn't-their-page a 403 or a placeholder. That is
 *      why thumbnails rendered as empty rectangles. A server-side fetch that
 *      looks like an ordinary browser and sends no referrer gets the bytes.
 *   2. Privacy. Panel HTML is authored by a model that has just been reading
 *      untrusted web pages, so a remote URL in it is a prompt-injection beacon:
 *      load it directly and the user's IP, and the fact they asked, go to a host
 *      the page chose. Proxying means the browser only ever talks to localhost
 *      and the page CSP can stay tight.
 *   3. One place to cap size, set timeouts and insist the bytes really are the
 *      media type they claim.
 *
 * The cost is that this process — unlike a browser tab — can reach the user's
 * LAN, their router's admin page, and cloud metadata endpoints. So everything
